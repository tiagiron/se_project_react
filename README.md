_Description_

This project utilized intermediate and advanced CSS/JavaScript and React principles in order to build a responsive design, make API calls, utilize navigation within the main and profile pages, and set up a mock server using json. React is used entirely for each component, making the forms and modals reusable and simply organized to allow for easy translation from other engineers. User-end validation for the forms and confirmation before deleting are also implemented for a friendly user experience.
